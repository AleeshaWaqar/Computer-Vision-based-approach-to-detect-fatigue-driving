# Computer-Vision-based-approach-to-detect-fatigue-driving
Traffic accidents caused by driver fatigue represent  a critical road safety challenge. This project presents a real time driver fatigue detection system implemented on NVIDIA  Jetson Nano. The system employs MTCNN ,depth-separable  CNN optimized from MobileNetV2.
